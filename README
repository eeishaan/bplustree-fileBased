NOTE: The Program uses c++11 std. of c++, so kindly test it on a compatible machine and compiler

USAGE
---------------------------------
Command : bash run.bash FLAGS
Flags:
1. '0' - Results in reindexing the whole index.
2. '1' - Run the operations written in 'querysample.txt'

ex: bash run.bash 0

OUTPUT
---------------------------------
Stats are printed at the end of the output. Recommend : Use '>' to append to file and then analyze


CLEANING
---------------------------------
Use bash clean.bash to delete the index.


RESULT (with n=32)
---------------------------------
***INSERT OPERATION***
MIN TIME: 0ms
MAX TIME : 110ms
TOTAL TIME : 524ms
AVERAGE TIME : 0ms
STANDARD DEVIATION : 4ms

***POINT OPERATION***
MIN TIME: 0ms
MAX TIME : 1ms
TOTAL TIME : 121ms
AVERAGE TIME : 0ms
STANDARD DEVIATION : 0ms

***RANGE OPERATION***
MIN TIME: 0ms
MAX TIME : 380ms
TOTAL TIME : 116046ms
AVERAGE TIME : 116ms
STANDARD DEVIATION : 76.1577ms


CONCLUSION:
---------------------------------
1. B+ tree implementation is not good for range queries as they take a lot of time.
2. INSERT and Point Operations take constant time.
3. Range query's time deviates the most as the number of operations is not fixed.
